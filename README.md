### Conversion of payments/receipts

A backup is created whenever you click "save".  Remove them when you're confident that it's all ok.

* It only uses payments/receipts that contain one line of transaction inside.  ie. freshly imported transactions.
* The exchange rate is only checked when transfering from accounts with different currencies.
* The minimum date should be zero unless you transfer to an account in another time zone which could mean the transfer goes back in time.
